# Installation

## Stable release

To install Flake8 Django Plugin, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install flake8-django-plugin
```

This is the preferred method to install Flake8 Django Plugin, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

the [Github repo][].
